<p><i>A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that the Clipper BayPass pilot program will close in spring 2024. 
In fact, the program was renewed until June 2025 for continuing students who received the pass at its initiation.</i></p>

With the Clipper BayPass pilot program renewed until June 30, 2025 for continuing students, 
there is a possibility the all-access transit pass will be available for purchase to UC Berkeley as soon as fall 2025. 
Though the price is still to be determined, we built a <a href="#bp-calculator-div">tool</a> to check if BayPass will be worth it for Berkeley students with different transit needs. 

## BayPass Pilot Program

During the pandemic, transit ridership all across the Bay Area dropped significantly. Since then, ridership still remains lower than pre-pandemic numbers. From February 2023 to February 2024, average weekly ridership averaged 159,170 compared to 407,500 from February 2019 to February 2020.

To address low ridership, 27 transit agencies — including BART, AC Transit and Caltrain — worked together to form the Clipper BayPass program in fall 2022. 
BayPass piloted at 17 partner institutions, composed of select universities and affordable housing communities. 
Their end goal was to allow 50,000 BayPass recipients easier access to public transportation, improving transit ridership in the process, according to Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) spokesperson John Goodwin.

“(The program) is a direct result of the COVID pandemic and the sharp 90 percent drop in transit ridership practically overnight”, Goodwin said in an interview. 
“There was an urgent need to make Bay Area Transit simpler and more seamless — more customer focused. 
So this led to a 27 point transit transformation action plan that was adopted in 2021. A year later, roughly, came the BayPass.”

Participants of the program receive unlimited access to all bus, rail and ferry services in the Bay Area.
At UC Berkeley, 12,000 randomly selected students received free access through the 2023-2024 school year at no cost to the university, 
with the intention of growing ridership and proving viability of the program. 

In the first year, more than 2 million BayPass trips were recorded. 

Ridership trends are looking up. “People who have the BayPass are generally taking about 40 percent more transit trips than folks at Cal that don't have BayPass,” Goodwin said based on data from August 2022 to October 2023. “These trends are really encouraging.”


## How much is a BayPass worth?

Pricing for a BayPass is yet to be determined.

During a roundtable discussion between students and transit leaders hosted at UC Berkeley in March by various student organizations, 
including Telegraph for People and ASUC, 
the estimated cost to support a BayPass program was mentioned to be about $105 per student.

“The goal is to make (pricing) revenue neutral so then no transit operator is losing money on the deal,” Goodwin said. 
“That price is going to be informed by the actual travel patterns and usage of participants in the BayPass pilot at Berkeley over the last nearly two years,” 
added William Bacon, Assistant Director at MTC in the same interview.


Until a formal price is decided upon, it's unclear whether the BayPass will be cheaper than the normal BART fare for a typical Berkeley student. 
To address this question, we built a visual tool that accounts for ride frequency, distance, and BayPass cost, 
(we assumed that BART is the biggest cost-saver for students with BayPass, 
since most around-campus travel is already covered by AC Transit bus lines with the <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/StudentEasypass" target="_blank">EasyPass Clipper Card</a>):

## Moving Forward

Phase 1 of BayPass involved pilot programs with partner universities and local affordable housing communities. 
Phase 2 will involve the rollout of a BayPass program available for purchase by universities and employers.

Campus administration and the ASUC have discussed bringing BayPass to the student body as soon as fall 2025, according to Bacon.   

Currently, unlimited rides with AC Transit buses and Bear Transit shuttles are covered by the Class Pass transit fee. Typically, student fees are altered through student fee referenda, a special form of ASUC propositions. 

BayPass’ success may offer the opportunity to transform transportation in Berkeley and the Bay Area more broadly by making transit a more accessible option for trips that people might not otherwise take. 

“If we can get a broader cross section of people in the Bay Area to ride transit more often, it builds the habit of transit riding … you might see the default mode of driving drop a little bit,” Goodwin said. “Then you’ve got a really big impact.”
