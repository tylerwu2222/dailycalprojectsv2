With the BayPass pilot program coming to a close this Spring, there is a possibility that UC Berkeley, 
in collaboration with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, 
will bring the BayPass back to Berkeley as soon as the next school year. 
With the price for this new pass still to be determined, 
we built a <a href="#bp-calculator-div">tool</a> to help determine if BayPass will be worth it for Berkeley students with different transit needs. 

## BayPass Pilot Program

During the pandemic, transit ridership all across the Bay Area dropped significantly. Post-pandemic, ridership still remains lower than pre-pandemic numbers. From February 2023 to February 2024, average weekly ridership averaged 159,170 compared to 407,500 from February 2019 to February 2020 (pre-pandemic). 


To address this, 27 transit agencies – including BART, AC Transit and Caltrain – worked together to form the Clipper BayPass program in the fall of 2022. Their end goal is to enable the 50,000 BayPass recipients from 17 partner institutions, composed of select universities and affordable housing communities, to more easily access and use public transportation, improving transit ridership in the process, according to Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) spokesperson John Goodwin.

When asked about the origin of BayPass: “it's a direct result of the COVID pandemic and the immediate, sharp 90% drop in transit ridership practically overnight. There was an urgent need to make Bay Area Transit simpler and more seamless – more customer focused. So this led to a 27 point transit transformation action plan that was adopted in 2021 (…) a year later, roughly, came the BayPass” Goodwin said.

For institutions with access to the BayPass, trends are positive. Over the course of phase one of the pilot program, per data from Aug. 2022 to Oct. 2023, “people who have the BayPass are generally taking about 40% more transit trips than folks at Cal that don't have BayPass”, Goodwin said.

## How much is a BayPass worth?

Pricing for the BayPass varies. 
Currently, for UCSF, who purchased the BayPass for its employees and students, 
the BayPass costs $272 per year for its students. 

During the Advancing BayPass meeting hosted by Telegraph for People, 
a student organization at Berkeley, 
an estimated cost of BayPass was mentioned to be around $105 per semester per student. 

For MTC, “the goal is to make (pricing) revenue neutral so then no transit operator is losing money on the deal,” Goodwin said. 
“That price is going to be informed by the actual travel patterns and usage of participants in the BayPass pilot at Berkeley over the last nearly two years. 
That data will inform what that revenue neutral price would look like,” William Bacon, Assistant Director at MTC, added.

Until a formal price is decided upon, it's unclear whether the BayPass will be cheaper than the normal BART fare for most Berkeley students. 
To address this question, we built a visual tool that accounts for ride frequency, distance, and BayPass cost, 
(we assumed that the BART will be the biggest cost-saver for students with BayPass, 
since most around-campus travel is already covered by AC Transit bus lines with the <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/StudentEasypass" target="_blank">EasyPass Clipper Card</a>):

## Moving Forward

Phase 1 of the BayPass involved pilot programs with partner universities and local affordable housing communities. 
For UC Berkeley, 12,000 students received access at no cost to the university, with the intention of growing ridership and proving viability. 

Phase 2 will involve the rollout of a BayPass program available for purchase by universities and employers. 
In terms of timeline, Goodwin mentions that “the administration (MTC) and the ASUC have talked about exploring if BayPass could be implemented across the whole student body for the fall of 2025.” 
Thus, the decision to purchase the plan will be decided by students in a university-wide referendum.

Student fees are altered through student fee referenda, a special form of ASUC propositions. 
A vote is expected in Fall 2024 to determine the future of funding for the BayPass program. 
Students can vote on Calink during the voting period and find information regarding propositions on the ASUC website. 
Major considerations for this referendum will include fees for the BayPass program and its potential impact on student transportation use. 

The BayPass could even offer benefits to students and the community beyond providing a reliable option for commuter students. 
Goodwin predicts that the BayPass could “expand the customer's travel horizons in a meaningful way by making transit an option for trips that they might not otherwise take”. 
In addition, if the BayPass becomes more popular, and “the default mode for transit rising, then presumably you might see the default mode of driving drop a little bit and then you've got a really big impact,” Goodwin said.
