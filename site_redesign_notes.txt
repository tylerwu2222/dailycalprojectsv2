To run locally, run:
npm start

To build for production, run:
npm run build

To add a new article:
1) add mdx file to src/articles
2) run npm update-articles (can check all commands with npm run)
    - this will take the info from all the mdx files and store it in the json file, 
      articlesData.json located in src/page_data/articles
    - this will also add the visualizations listed in src/visuals based on the article name

To convert articles from Gatsby to react (still WIP):
1) run npm clean-gatsby


Formatting notes:
- Visuals should use PascalCase notation otherwise update-article script will not load viz (e.g. file should be named: 'DailyCalBarChart.js', and exported function should be 'DailyCalBarChart')
- Dates in mdx should have leading 0 for single-digit days or months

Using react-router-dom to navigate between pages.
- Article routes (urls) are defined dynamically in App.js
    - Route paths are currently: /article/urlified-title
- Links to article routes wrap the ArticleCard


## STAGING
to stage an article (make private), 
add staging: true into the front-matter of the mdx file 
--> run npm update articles
to remove from staging and deploy, simply remove staging from the front-matter
